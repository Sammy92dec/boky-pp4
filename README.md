The restaurant reservation app, "X," was designed to make dining experiences more efficient and enjoyable. It offers users the ability to book or cancel table reservations with ease while checking real-time availability. The app also allows for rescheduling reservations, ensuring flexibility for both diners and restaurant staff.

Beyond table bookings, "X" provides features for exploring upcoming events at the restaurant and sharing them with others, fostering engagement and community. With its user-friendly interface, "X" streamlines operations for the restaurant and enhances convenience for customers, creating a seamless dining journey.

The backend is implemented using Django Rest Framework API. It is designed to support both web and future mobile applications providing robust and secure APIs for the frontend application, ensuring seamless integration and future scalability.
