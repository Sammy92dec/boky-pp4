# Testing and Validating
### Manual Testing

Testing was done throughout the process while developing the project by the use of Django debug pages and printing statements to check that the code functioned accordingly. In addition, thorough testing has been performed and is described below, it contains manual test to check that all user stories and acceptance criteria are met, as well as testing and validating the code with different online tools as presented below.

### Browser Testing
Testing has been carried out on the following browsers:

- Google Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

The site was constantly tested during the process of creating the site in the Gitpod Environment and the deployed site on Heroku was also tested in terms of user experience. The available functionality and user experience is reflected in the table below.

## Deployment

- The deployment process for Sam's Bistro involves multiple platforms, including GitHub, Gitpod, Heroku,  CI Postgresql, and Cloudinary. Below is a detailed explanation of how each platform fits into the deployment process along with the respective URLs for the platforms and services used in deploying and managing the Fit and Fine DRF API.

### 1. GitHub

- **Purpose:** 
  - Version control and collaboration.

- **Process:**
  - The source code for Sam's Bistro is hosted on GitHub. Developers can collaborate, track changes, and manage different versions of the application.
  - The repository is used as the central hub for the project, where all updates and changes are committed and pushed.

- **URL:**
  - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com)

### 2. Gitpod

- **Purpose:**
  - Online IDE for development.

- **Process:**
  - Gitpod is used for development and testing. It provides a cloud-based development environment that is pre-configured with the necessary tools and dependencies.
  - Developers can open the GitHub repository in Gitpod and start coding immediately without worrying about local setup.

- **URL:**
  - [Gitpod Workspace](https://gitpod.io/)

### 3. Heroku

- **Purpose:**
  - Platform as a Service (PaaS) for hosting the application.

- **Process:**
  - The Bistro application is deployed on Heroku. Heroku manages the server, deployment, and scaling of the application.
  - Continuous deployment is set up from the GitHub repository to Heroku, ensuring that any changes pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed to the live site.

- **URL:**
  - [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)

- **Setting up on Heroku:**
  1. Create a new app on Heroku.
  2. Connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository.
  3. Set up Config Vars in Heroku including `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `CLOUDINARY_URL`, `ALLOWED_HOST`  and `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1` (this is temporary and can be removed for the final deployment).
  4. Deploy the main branch using the Heroku dashboard or enable automatic deployments for every push to the main branch.

- **For deployment, Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly:**
    - `requirements.txt`
    - `Procfile`

- You can install this project's requirements (where applicable) using:
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs to be updated using:
  - `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`

- **The Procfile can be created with the following command:**
  - `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`

- Then add these lines to Procfile

  - `web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi`

  - `release: python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate`

- Replace `app_name` with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where `settings.py` is located.

### 4.  Code Insistute Postgresql

- **Purpose:**
  - Database as a Service for PostgreSQL.

- **Process:**
  - Code Insistute provided the PostgreSQL database for the application. The database is used to store all application data, including user information, posts, comments, and other relevant data.
  - Heroku is configured to use the postgresql database through environment variables.

To obtain your own PostgreSQL Database from Code insistute you need to be a student and they will provide database linked to your student email, where they will email you database URL.

### 5. Cloudinary

- **Purpose:**
  - Media management and storage.

- **Process:**
  - Cloudinary is used for storing and managing media files, such as images and videos uploaded by users.
  - The application is configured to upload media files directly to Cloudinary, where they are stored and served.

- **URL:**
  - [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/users/login)

- **Integration:**
1. Set up a Cloudinary account.
2. Configure the Cloudinary settings in the Django settings file with the API keys provided by Cloudinary.
3. Use Djangoâ€™s storage backend for Cloudinary to handle media uploads.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine or open it in Gitpod for development.

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   - Set up the necessary environment variables in your local `.env` file or in the Heroku dashboard. These include database URL (ElephantSQL), Cloudinary API keys, and other sensitive information.

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

4. **Run Migrations:**
   - Apply database migrations using `python manage.py migrate` to set up the PostgreSQL database schema.

5. **Test the Application:**
   - Run the application locally or in Gitpod to ensure it works as expected.

6. **Deploy to Heroku:**
   - Push the changes to the GitHub repository, which triggers the continuous deployment to Heroku.
   - Ensure that the Heroku app is properly configured with the necessary environment variables and add-ons (such as Postgresql).

7. **Manage Media Files:**
   - Configure Cloudinary in the Django settings and ensure that media files are uploaded and managed correctly.

# Cloning and Forking
### Cloning the Repository

**Local Setup:**
1. Clone the repository: [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sammy92dec/boky-pp4). 
   - `git clone https://github.com/Sammy92dec/boky-pp4`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd boky-pp4`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up local environment variables in a `.env` file.
5. Run migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations`and`python manage.py migrate`
6. Start the development server: `python manage.py runserver`


### Forking the Repository

**For Contributions:**
1. Fork the repository on [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sammy92dec/boky-pp4).
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. Follow the local setup steps as above.
4. Make changes and push them back to your fork.
5. Create a pull request from your fork back to the original repo.
